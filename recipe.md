~RECIPE~
1.   Add 225g unsalted melted butter, 3 room temperature eggs, 1 tbsp (15ml) coffee and 1 tbsp (15ml) vanilla to a large bowl then whisk together. The coffee is optional. If you don’t want to use any just skip or add a drop more of vanilla.

2.   Add 1 cup (200g) of granulated white sugar and 1 cup (200g) of lightly packed brown sugar to the mixture. 

3.   Whisk the mixture together until it’s nice and smooth.

4.   Sift in 1 cup (120g) of flour, 1 teaspoon (6g) of salt and ¾ cup (75g) cocoa powder. It is important to sift as the cocoa is often pretty lumpy.

5.   Stir the mixture together until just incorporated.

6.   Fold in 1.5 cup (260g) of dark chocolate chips or chunks. While you have the spatula out it’s a good time to scrape the bottom of the bowl and really make sure there are no pockets of unmixed ingredients hanging out.

7.   Transfer the batter to a parchment-lined baking dish and smooth it to the corners. Bake at 350F for about 30 minutes.

8.   You can add either chopped chocolate or chocolate chips to the top of your brownies but this is totally optional.
